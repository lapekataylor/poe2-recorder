# Changelog

Notable changes to PoE Recorder. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

PoE Recorder is based on Warcraft Recorder's native Linux/Wayland port,
[JohanWes/wow-recorder-linuxwayland](https://github.com/JohanWes/wow-recorder-linuxwayland),
whose history follows the 0.1.0 entry below. Earlier history belongs to the
upstream Electron project,
[aza547/wow-recorder](https://github.com/aza547/wow-recorder).

## Unreleased

### Added
- Path of Exile 1 map runs: turn on **Path of Exile logs** in Settings. Both
  games can be watched at once.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Automatic recording of Path of Exile 2 map runs from `Client.txt`: a run
  starts on entering a map, survives trips to the hideout within a grace
  period (5 minutes by default), and treats Abyss and similar sub-areas as
  part of the map.
- Death markers and "Out of the map" spans on the timeline.
- Map-run videos are cut five seconds after the player last left the map.
- A map in progress when the app starts is recorded at once.
- Map runs library section with map, area level and death columns.
- Recording resolution setting: Native, 1440p, 1080p or 720p.

### Changed
- Renamed to PoE Recorder (`io.github.lapekataylor.PoeRecorder`).
- Test recordings simulate a short map run.
- New app icon.
- Settings recommend sharing the whole screen rather than the game window,
  which stops recording when the game closes.

### Removed
- World of Warcraft support: combat-log parsing, raid, dungeon, arena and
  battleground categories, advanced-combat-logging checks, the combat meter,
  the spell database, multi-viewpoint grouping, and importing Warcraft
  Recorder's Electron-era recordings.

## Warcraft Recorder for Linux, unreleased

### Fixed
- The damage meter's right-click menu shows its Target entry in full instead
  of cutting it off behind a scrollbar.

## 1.0.11 - 2026-09-26

### Changed
- Damage meters load on demand for the selected recording instead of staying
  in memory for the whole library. On a 58-recording library, idle memory
  after the startup scan drops from 415 MB to 30 MB and the scan from 2.4 s to
  1.0 s; startup reads each sidecar once.
- Sidecars are written as compact JSON, about a third of the size. Existing
  ones are rewritten the next time they are tagged or protected.
- The spell database ships as a separately installed, memory-mapped resource:
  the binary shrinks from 29 MB to 5 MB, an update downloads about 5 MB instead
  of 17 MB, and about 40 MB less memory is used.
- The bundled FFmpeg drops x264, swscale, avdevice and unused filters, and
  Flatpak release builds use link-time optimization.
- The video backend starts on first playback. An empty-library window idles at
  147 MB and 31 threads instead of 186 MB and 53; a tray-only session at 57 MB
  and 12 threads.
- The combat meter updates rows in place with animations, throttles refreshes
  while scrubbing, and loads the spell database off the UI thread.
- The library keeps focus, scroll and selection across refreshes, shows a
  loading page at startup, crossfades between states, flips the protect star
  immediately, and reports busy state, clips and deletions as toasts instead
  of a layout-shifting banner.
- The window no longer polls four times a second, and the timeline repaints
  only when the playhead moves.

### Fixed
- A raid pull or Mythic+ run that started while the previous activity was
  still ending was silently dropped; both are now recorded.
- The gpu-screen-recorder restart backoff resets after a minute of stable
  running, so a later crash no longer leaves capture unarmed for 30 s.
- Discarding a capture while a save was queued or running could move that
  save's files to Recovery and fail it. Cleanup now waits for media work to
  finish and only touches the failed capture.
- Per-spell target samples in newly recorded meters were one lead-in early.
- Test recordings are labelled as such in the status card.
- Starting minimized no longer loads and plays the newest recording in the
  background.
- Player shortcuts no longer fire inside dialogs and popovers.
- Deleting the last visible recording unloads it from the player.
- Arrow keys in the category sidebar switch the category.
- The viewpoint selector refreshes when a viewpoint is added to the selected
  activity.
- The Settings dialog and row context menus no longer leak memory on every
  open.
- Unreadable sidecars are logged instead of being skipped silently.

### Removed
- Dead code: never-produced recorder statuses, the no-op timeline action,
  unread combat-event fields and recorder API, and test-only log tailer modes.
  Activity data tables moved to their own module.

## 1.0.10 - 2026-09-09

### Added
- The combat meter gains a Buffs tab with per-player buff uptime, and the
  buff list shows buff icons instead of a folded "Other" row.

### Changed
- Startup and bulk library edits are faster. Orphan detection and sidecar
  loading no longer build throwaway JSON trees, the scan orders entries
  without cloning them, and tagging or protecting many recordings lets the
  coordinator service the recorder and combat log between writes. On a
  498 MiB library the pre-library-snapshot work drops from 2.2 s to 1.1 s at
  half the peak memory, and protecting 37 recordings from 2.1 s to 0.79 s.

### Removed
- The AppImage migration path and the one-time Electron config import with its
  post-migration notice are gone. Every user is on the Flatpak now.
- The one-time startup backfill that rewrote old Electron sidecars with
  Bloodlust timelines parsed from historical combat logs is gone. Sidecars
  that were already enriched keep their timeline.
- A recording made by the old Electron application whose category is not one
  this application knows is now skipped instead of being listed under an
  "Unknown" category. Recordings in the normal categories are unaffected.
- Old Electron recordings no longer report a video codec in the library. Every
  other detail they carry is unchanged.
- Dead code left behind by earlier removals: the imported-path constructor
  orphaned by the Electron config import, an unused spell-database size
  accessor, a write-only first-time-setup flag, a duplicate spell-data fetch
  script, and a development-only meter replay example.

## 1.0.9 - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- A seek issued while Clapper is still prerolling is deferred until the item
  is ready, instead of dropping it and wedging every later seek for that
  video.
- Scrubbing back past the first cast of a selected meter spell no longer
  panics the process.
- A second launcher invocation claims the single-instance lock before any
  storage work, so it no longer moves the first instance's active recording
  into Recovery.

### Changed
- Finishing a recording, deleting, and evicting now update the library index
  in place instead of rescanning the whole library, which blocked the
  coordinator and allocated heavily on large libraries.
- A hidden combat meter no longer rebuilds its widgets on every tick, and the
  occurrence and death histories are virtualized, keeping large meters cheap.

## 1.0.8 - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Captures that begin and end in the same moment no longer desynchronize the
  gpu-screen-recorder recording toggle, which had silently stopped every later
  capture from producing a file.
- A capture that produces no video file now replaces the recorder child, so
  the next recording still saves instead of going silent.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-08-21

### Added
- A local combat meter is available alongside each recording, with damage
  done, damage taken, healing, interrupts, dispels, casts and deaths. It
  supports current-fight and overall views, player spell and target
  breakdowns, and seeking from meter rows into the video.
- Previous and next controls jump between the visible combat-timeline markers.

### Changed
- Player controls now focus on video and combat review; the drawing overlay
  has been removed.

### Fixed
- Combat logs with the newer UTC-offset timestamp suffix are parsed instead of
  silently rejecting every event.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Midnight patch 12.1 raid encounters and Mythic+ dungeons are now recognized
  and recorded.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- Resolved screen-capture crashes no longer leave stale problem indicators
  after automatic restart, rearming, or capture-target reselection.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- Combat-log timestamps now use the system timezone and daylight-saving
  changes instead of UTC.
- A stale saved-recording event can no longer be attached to a newer
  recording.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-08-08

### Fixed
- Restarting the media worker no longer deadlocks when the worker is busy:
  the shutdown request now waits to be delivered instead of being dropped.
- Folder validation no longer overwrites an existing probe file: the write
  probe uses an exclusive unique name and reports write failures.

### Changed
- `install.sh` is the documented one-command install: on a machine without an
  AppImage it only adds the remote, installs the app, and starts it, and a
  re-run updates an existing install instead of failing. Missing Flatpak now
  prints the command that installs it, and the installer warns when the
  session cannot record: X11, no screen-capture portal, or no PipeWire, each
  with the fix spelled out.
- README rewritten for players: one install command, the three things the
  system needs, first-run steps, and measured footprint against the Electron
  build.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-07-28

### Added
- A "What's new" dialog on the first start after an update, listing the
  commits between the previous release and the installed version. Closing it
  records the version, so it appears once per update.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- The post-migration notice stayed pending after being dismissed, so it
  reappeared on every start: a settings save carried the draft the notice
  itself had opened Settings on, writing the pending flag back.
- "Advanced combat logging is off" was reported for every sandboxed install.
  The check reads `Config.wtf` beside the Logs folder, which the folder portal
  does not export, so an unreadable file now reads as unknown rather than off.
- The AppImage migration left the old app running and its binary on disk.

### Added
- The recording folder and combat-log folder rows pulse until they are
  selected, including after a migration, where the imported paths need picking
  again before the sandbox can reach them.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-27

### Added
- Native Rust/GTK4 application: combat-log watching, activity detection,
  `gpu-screen-recorder` capture, JSON sidecar library, playback with a combat
  timeline, clipping, drawing overlay, and local POV switching.
- Live keystone timers from the API when computing a Mythic+ result, with
  hardcoded timers as a fallback.
- A one-time notice on the first launch after a legacy import: what changed,
  what carried over, and the two folders the sandbox needs selected again.

### Changed
- Flatpak is the only install and update path. Recordings and configuration
  stay local; legacy configuration is imported once and left untouched.
- Cloud, account, upload, and localization features are not part of this fork.
- `install.sh` migrates an AppImage install instead of replacing it: it
  installs the Flatpak, preserves the AppImage for rollback, retires the
  AppImage launchers, and starts the native app.
